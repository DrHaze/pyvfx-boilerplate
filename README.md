pyVFX-boilerplate
==================

A boilerplate for creating PyQt/PySide applications running in Maya, Nuke or completely standalone.

Edit boilerplate.pyw and edit the "QtType" variable to say either "PySide" or "PyQt".
Then just execute boilerplate.pyw either inside of Nuke, Maya or as standalone. Please note that Maya 2013 and above as well as Nuke 6.3 and above has native support for PySide.

The script is setup in such a way that .ui files are loaded the same way whether you use PySide or PyQt.
