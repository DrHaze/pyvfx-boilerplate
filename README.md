pyvfx-boilerplate
==================

A boilerplate for creating PyQt4/PySide and PyQt5/PySide2 applications running in Maya, Nuke or completely standalone.

## Documentation

### Version 2.x

#### Changes from 1.0

- Complete rewrite of the boilerplate.
- Requires the [`Qt.py`](https://github.com/mottosso/Qt.py) module (v0.2.5) to detect Qt bindings.
- Uses `PySide.QUiTools` instead of `pysideuic`, which was used in v1.0.
- No longer uses the complex "wrap instance" approach in favor for simpler code. Because of this, UIs are no longer loaded into `self`.
- Maya palette removed (will be back soon).
- Git repo name change: all lowercase.
- Pretty much PEP8 compliant.
- Now comes with `Qt.WindowStaysOnTopHint` out of the box.
- Can be run in multiple ways (see examples).

#### Noteworthy known issues

- Does not work with Nuke 10.0v1 on OS X: [#7](https://github.com/fredrikaverpil/pyvfx-boilerplate/issues/7)
- Maya palette glitchy in standalone mode with PySide/PyQt4 on OS X (disabled by default): [#9](https://github.com/fredrikaverpil/pyvfx-boilerplate/issues/9)

#### Installation

Please note, this boilerplate requires [`Qt.py`](https://github.com/mottosso/Qt.py).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pyvfx-boilerplate.git
pip install -U Qt.py
```

#### Example usage

Run as standalone:

```python
python boilerplate.py
```

Run in script editor of Maya or Nuke:

```python
import sys
sys.path.append('/path/to/pyvfx-boilerplate')
import boilerplate

boilerplate.run_maya()  # or boilerplate.run_nuke()
```

You can also copy-paste the boilerplate.py contents into the script editor of Maya or Nuke and just execute it. Make sure you set the path to your .ui files prior to executing the code.

#### Modifying the boilerplate

- Open up `boilerplate.py` and scroll down to the `# Configuration` section and review the settings.
- Rename every occurance of `boil` in the code to reflect a unique name for your application.
- Change the class `Boilerplate` to your heart's content!

#### Development guidelines

Since the boilerplate relies on [`Qt.py`](https://github.com/mottosso/Qt.py), you should design your application as if you were designing it for PyQt5/PySide2. This means creating widgets using `QtWidgets` rather than `QtGui`. The `Qt.py` module takes care of the remapping and makes for compatibility with PyQt4/PySide. Read more over at the [`Qt.py` repository](https://github.com/mottosso/Qt.py).

Tip: when you cannot rely on `Qt.py`, create an issue (probably over at [`Qt.py`](https://github.com/mottosso/Qt.py)) and/or detect which binding is being used and write some custom code:

```python
from Qt import __binding__

if __binding__.startswith('PyQt'):
    ...
elif __binding.startswith('PySide'):
    ...
```
